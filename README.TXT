README FOR HELLCAT'S PANDORA INSTALLER SOURCE


As a strong friend and believer of open source software and its benefits
I, as usual, release this version of the Pandora-Installer including its
source for everyone to lurk in and check out.


HOWEVER:

* LICENSE

The Pandora-Installer and it's source are released under the GPL.
A copy of the full text can be found in "LICENSE.TXT" in this folder.

In very short: You are allowed to study, recompile and create own apps,
based on the source of this one as long as you include propper credits
and your source as well with your release!


* Chaos

Due to the nature of the original (R1) release and the constant addition
of new functions, features and other changes the source is.... well....
"a bit messy" ;-)

I am aiming (once time permits) for a complete rewrite....

So, with looking at the code, you agree to the possibility of hurting
your eyes because of what you see ;-)


Now, with that all said, and to ensure you agree to all of what is written
here, you need a password to access the archive containing the source!
And here it is:
